A Nonparanormal Approach to Combining Textual and Visual Information for Predicting and Generating Popular Meme Descriptions", to appear in the 2015 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics â€“ Human Language Technologies (NAACL HLT 2015), long paper, Denver, CO., USA, May 31-June 5, ACL.
